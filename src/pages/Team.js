                All four of us have our own stories of how we overcame disordered eating and broken body image. Because of that, we have a shared passion and drive to help others accept and love the bodies they are in.

                We each independently had ideas of creating a space where people could learn how to heal their relationship with food and their bodies. We all crossed paths in different ways, and knew we had to create something together.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, we created Every Body! A place where we hope people can become better educated and more connected, through learning from trained therapists and dietitians.

                Thank you for the support and love you have shown us thus far. We canâ€™t wait to learn and grow with you!
